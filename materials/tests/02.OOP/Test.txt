Q. 01.	You are tasked with creating a method for several classes.

		the others. Each class defines its own functionality for that 
		particular method.

		a derived class, Motorboat, which inherits the Boat class, but 
		defines different functionality for that method, and hides the 
		abstract method. What implementation would you use?

	{
		public override void Vroom()
		{
			//some functionality
		}
	}

		{	
			return -1;
		}
		else 
		{
			return 0;
		}
	}
b) 
	public int CompareTo(object obj)
	{
		Rectangle target = (Rectangle)obj;
		double diff = this.GetArea() − target.GetArea();
		if (target == 0)
		{
			return 0;
		}
		else if (target > 0)
		{	
			return 1;
		}
		else 
		{

		}
	}
c)

		if (diff == 0)
		{
			return 0;
		}
		else if (diff < 0)
		{	
			return 1;
		}
		else 
		{
